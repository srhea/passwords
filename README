passwords - an embarrassingly simple password safe

Highlights:
  - Functional: stores all your passwords in a single, encrypted file
  - Secure: 256-bit AES encryption
  - Verifiable: less than 300 lines of Scala code
  - Durable: backup ~/.passwords with Dropbox, or email, or whatever
  - Free: MIT license

The goal of this program is to be moderately more user friendly than storing
passwords in a plain text file encrypted with GnuPG, while at the same time
being short and simple enough that any competent programmer can convince
themselves of its correctness in under 30 minutes. 

Example usage:

  $ passwords 
  Usage:
    passwords <command> [<args>]
  Commands:
    generate [length]
    add <url> <username>
    remove <url> <username>
    search <search string>

  $ passwords generate
  g9mYO:=[

  $ passwords add https://www.mint.com/ johndoe
  No existing passwords database.
  Enter a master password: 
  Confirm master password: 
  Password: <copy/paste "g9mYO:=[" from above>

  $ passwords search mint
  Master password: 
  https://www.mint.com/ johndoe g9mYO:=[

  $ passwords remove https://www.mint.com/ johndoe
  Master password: 
  Really remove this entry? (Y/N): y

Installation instructions for Mac/Unix:

  1. Download and install Scala:
  
     cd ~/Downloads
     wget 'http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/distrib/files/scala-2.9.2.tgz'
     cd /usr/local
     sudo tar xzvf ~/Downloads/scala-2.9.2.tgz
     sudo chmod a+x scala-2.9.2/bin/scala
     cd bin
     sudo ln -s ../scala-2.9.2/bin/scala

  2. Download and install this passwords:

     cd ~/Downloads
     wget 'https://github.com/srhea/passwords/blob/master/passwords'
     chmod a+x passwords
     sudo cp passwords /usr/local/bin

Note:

I wrote passwords in Scala because of the languages I know well, Scala
produces shorter, more readable code than C++, and I trust Scala's
cryptographic primitives more than those in Ruby.

Enjoy!
